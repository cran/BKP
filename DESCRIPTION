Description: Implements the Beta Kernel Process (BKP) for nonparametric modeling of spatially varying binomial probabilities, together with its extension, the Dirichlet Kernel Process (DKP), for categorical or multinomial data.
 The package provides functions for model fitting, predictive inference with uncertainty quantification, posterior simulation, and visualization in one-and two-dimensional input spaces.
 Multiple kernel functions (Gaussian, Matern 5/2, and Matern 3/2) are supported, with hyperparameters optimized through multi-start gradient-based search.
